    "lesson1_begin": "In order to help Robert further, we must first learn about the coordinate plane.",
    "lesson1_0": "The coordinate plane is a two-dimensional surface made up of two lines: horizontal and vertical.",
    "lesson1_1": "First, the horizontal line: The X-axis.",
    "lesson1_2": "Starting from the origin, the positive X values go right.",
    "lesson1_3": "...and the negative X values go left.",
    "lesson1_4": "Now, the vertical line: The Y-axis.",
    "lesson1_5": "Starting from the origin, the positive Y values go up.",
    "lesson1_6": "...and the negative Y values go down.",
    "lesson1_7": "When you pair both the X and Y values together, you'll get a coordinate.",
    "lesson1_8": "The coordinate is where the X and Y axis lines intersect. Watch the two values change as Robert moves.",
    "lesson1_9": "Next up, we will go over the quadrants.",
    "lesson2_0": "The quadrants are the four sections of the coordinate plane.",
    "lesson2_1": "As you can see, the quadrants are divided by the X and Y axis from the origin.",
    "lesson2_2": "Each one determines the sign values of the X and Y: positive or negative.",
    "lesson2_3": "Now let's help Robert move from Quadrant 1 to Quadrant 2.",
    "lesson2_4": "Nice! Next stop: Quadrant 3.",
    "lesson2_5": "One last destination: Quadrant 4.",
    "lesson2_6": "Excellent! You are now ready to guide Robert back to his family.",
    "lesson3_0": "Now we will go over reflection.",
    "lesson3_1": "A point is reflected by flipping the signs of its values: positive to negative, and vice-versa.",
    "lesson3_2": "Here you can see the X value reflected across the Y-axis.",
    "lesson3_3": "â€¦and the Y value, which is reflected across the X-axis.",
    "lesson3_4": "By reflecting both the X and Y values, you can see the line connecting both points run across the origin.",
    "lesson3_5": "The two points have an equal distance from the origin.",
    "lesson3_6": "Now let's put this into practice! Place the matching reflections on the highlighted tiles.",
    "intro_0": "This is Robert. He has been running in circles for ages.",
    "intro_1": "Please, break this cycle so that he may be reunited with his family!",
    "intro_2": "Excellent! With your guidance, Robert can finally move on.",
    "end_0": "After a long arduous journey, Robert is finally united with his family!",
